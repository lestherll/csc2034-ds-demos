During a Grid Search, we provide a list of values to try out for each hyperparameter. In practise a subset of hyperparameters are used, especially for deep learning models - in my research a grid search on a deep learning model took just over 1 month to finish using 2 GPUs!\n",

        "When we perform hyperparameter tuning, we don't want to expose our model to the test set as this may impact generalisation and stops us being able to produce a final evaluation on unseen data. With large datasets, often the train set will be split further into an evaluation set to get around this. The train set will be used for training, hyperparameter searches will be evaluated against the evaluation set, and the test set will be reserved for final evaluation on unseen data. \n",

Again you will go into more detail in your lectures, but cross validation allows you to split your training set multiple times into N *folds*. Hyperparameter tuning is then performed on the combination of these folds. This gives us, in essence, both a training and validation set even though we have very little data to work with. \n",
